Solver for one-dimensional parabolic and elliptic nonlinear partial differential equations.

This package is based on the spatial discretization method introduced by Skeel and Berzins in [1]. For transient problems, the time discretization is performed either by the implicit Euler method (internal method) or by using an ODE/DAE solver from the [DifferentialEquations.jl](https://github.com/SciML/DifferentialEquations.jl) package.
